# Task Modify

Adapt the code to:
- Make it assign input into the 'name' variable. CHALLENGE - put a prompt in the input command to ask the user for their name. 

- Combine lines 'Do you like programming' and answer = input  so that it the input has a prompt in it.

- Make the output on the next to last line include both the name and the answer variables.

- Add comments to explain what you have changed.

## Help! My code doesn't work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- you have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the correct **operator**
    - <pre>+ addition
    - <pre>- subtraction
    - <pre>* multiplication
    - <pre>/ decimal division (gives numbers after the decimal point)
    - <pre>// integer division (just gives the whole number part of the answer)
- You have remembered the brackets after input:
    - <pre> input()
